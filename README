==( about : 1. About LuaExec )==

===( overview : 1.1 Overview )===

LuaExec is another take on multitasking for Lua. 

LuaExec is mainly focused on general applicability, simplicity and
concise semantics. It provides multiple contexts of execution in the
most abstract sense, behaving understandably, platform-independently
and unencumbered by OS specific details.

===( demarcation : 1.2 What it does and doesn't )===

 * runs a Lua interpreter per task
 * is recursive, a child task can itself require the module, run
 child tasks, and see all other tasks
 * data exchange using messages, signals, arguments and return values
 * allows to synchronize on: task completion, signals, messages
 * abstract signals: a, t, c, m (abort, terminate, child, message)
 * tasks can find each other by name or by parent
 * no shared data, no marshalling, this is at the user's discretion
 * no operating system details (e.g. priorities)

===( implementation : 1.3 Implementation details )===

 * LuaExec is a regular module using only the legal Lua API.
 * It should work with Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, and LuaJIT2.0 on POSIX and
 Windows. Not all combinations are fully tested yet.
 * Child tasks are subject to garbage collection in their parent
 that created them. Their underlying OS threads are always joined
 and ''never killed forcibly'', and all resources requested in any
 task are meant to be returned, at the latest through garbage
 collection.
 * A Lua error in a task raises a signal, a (abort), that is by
 default propagated to the parent task.
 * Child tasks and tasks that spawned children are, by default,
 supplied with a debug hook that checks for the abortion signal,
 where it raises an error, signals its parent, and so forth.
 * The hook can be disabled on a per-task basis. In such tasks
 abortion strikes only when they are suspended in wait, sleep etc.

===( status : 1.4. Status, outlook )===

This project is a prototype and request for comments. Additions,
suggestions, improvements, bug fixes are likely needed and welcome.
Performance was no consideration yet. In its current stage LuaExec
is about getting semantics right. Some considerations:

 * Because LuaExec is recursive in that child tasks can create new
 tasks that can see other tasks (and can be seen by other tasks),
 LuaExec could easily provide a shared data or registry mechanism.
 This is currently being investigated. 

 * LuaExec's protocol and API should remain (or become) transparent
 as to whether it is implemented as threads or processes, or as
 threads or processes on different hosts.
 
 * Support for serialization or marshalling

 * Given sufficient interest, this library might be extended in a way
 that other Lua modules and libraries can be written against
 LuaExec's C and Lua APIs, so that future Lua sockets and I/O,
 libraries and applications can converge and be synchronized on
 atomically in a platform-independent, Lua-ish way.
 
This project is a spin-off from the
[[tekUI project][http://tekui.neoscientists.org/]]. The LuaExec 0.80
module is fully contained in (but usable independently of) tekUI
version 1.11. The reason for outsourcing was to have a separate
testbed and package that is unencumbered by the requirements and
complexity of graphical input and output. There are a few examples
in this package that can be run against tekUI, and there are a few
more tasks examples in the tekUI package.

===( license : 1.5. License )===

LuaExec is free software under the same license as Lua itself: It can
be used for both academic and commercial purposes at no cost. It
qualifies as Open Source software, and its license is compatible with
the GPL – see [[copyright][copyright.html]]. Additional components
are available under a commercial license – see below.

==( buildinstall : 2. Building and installing )==

===( requirements : 2.1. Requirements )===

 * Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, LuaJIT 2.x
 * GCC or LLVM/clang
 * MinGW for building for the Windows platform

Only for the included webserver and documentation generator:
Lua 5.2 and 5.3 must be compiled with {{LUA_COMPAT_MODULE}}.

==== External Lua modules ====

LuaExec does not strictly depend on any external Lua modules. The
following modules are supported:

 * [[LuaFileSystem][http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/]]
 for the HTTP server example and documentation generator
 * [[LuaSocket][http://w3.impa.br/~diego/software/luasocket/]]
 for the HTTP server example
 
===( buildenv : 2.2. Adjusting the build environment )===

If building fails for you, you may have to adjust the build
environment, which is located in the {{config}} file on the topmost
directory level. Supported build tools are {{gmake}} (common under
Linux) and {{pmake}} (common under FreeBSD). More build options and
peculiarities are documented in the tekUI package, many of which
apply to the LuaExec package as well.

==== BSD notes ====

On FreeBSD and NetBSD you need a Lua binary which is linked with the
{{-pthread}} option, as LuaExec is using multithreaded code in shared
libraries, which are dynamically loaded by the interpreter.

===( building : 2.3. Building )===

To see all build targets, type

  # make help

The regular build procedure is invoked with

  # make all

===( installation : 2.4. Installation )===

A system-wide installation of LuaExec is not strictly required. Once
it is built, it can be worked with and developed against, as long as
you stay in the top-level directory of the distribution; all required
modules will be found if programs are started from there.

If staying in the top-level directory is not desirable, then LuaExec
must be installed globally. By default, the installation paths are

 - {{/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1}}
 - {{/usr/local/share/lua/5.1}}

It is not unlikely that this is different from what is common for
your operating system, distribution or development needs, so be sure
to adjust these paths in the {{config}} file. The installation is
conveniently invoked with

  # sudo make install
  
===( gendoc : 2.5 Documentation system )===

LuaExec comes with a documentation generator. It is capable of
generating a function reference and hierarchical class index from
specially crafted comments in the source code. To regenerate the
full documentation, invoke

  # make docs

Note that you need
[[LuaFileSystem][http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/]] for
the document generator to process the file system hierarchy.

==( examples : 3. Examples )==

===( tests : 3.1 Tests )===

Tests are under {{bin/task/}}.

===( httpserver : 3.2 HTTP Server example )===

As an example, a small HTTP server is included that can be run in
the background like this:

  local exec = require "tek.lib.exec"
  local httpd = exec.run(function()
    require "tek.class.httpd":new {
      Listen = arg[1], DocumentRoot = "doc"
    }:run()
  end, arg[1] or "localhost:8080")
  -- ... do something else ...
  httpd:terminate() -- or httpd:join()

To start it serving LuaExec's documentation (default localhost:8080):

  # bin/webserver.lua [host:port]

It requires luasocket and lfs. The server itself is not
multithreaded, but it supports copas/coxpcall if available. Please
note that the HTTP/1.1 part of the webserver is just a hack to have
a funny example to work with. It was more written against a browser
than against the specification.

=== HTTP server test pages ===

These links should work when you have loaded this document from the
provided HTTP server:

 * CGI test page: [[/webserver/testcgi.lua]]
 * Formtest Lua page: [[/webserver/formtest.lhtml]]
 * Webserver control Lua page: [[/webserver/control.lhtml]]
