		<div class="node"><h3><a name="overview" id="overview">1.1 Overview</a></h3>
			<p>
				LuaExec is another take on multitasking for Lua.
			</p>
			<p>
				LuaExec is mainly focused on general applicability, simplicity and
				concise semantics. It provides multiple threads of execution in the
				most abstract sense, behaving understandably, platform-independently
				and unencumbered by OS specific details.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="demarcation" id="demarcation">1.2 What it does and doesn't</a></h3>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						runs a Lua interpreter per task
					</li>
					<li>
						is recursive, a child task can itself require the module, run
						child tasks, and see all other tasks
					</li>
					<li>
						data exchange using messages, signals, arguments and return values
					</li>
					<li>
						allows to synchronize on: task completion, signals, messages
					</li>
					<li>
						abstract signals: a, t, c, m (abort, terminate, child, message)
					</li>
					<li>
						tasks can find each other by name or by parent
					</li>
					<li>
						no shared data, no marshalling, this is at the user's discretion
					</li>
					<li>
						no operating system details (e.g. priorities)
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="implementation" id="implementation">1.3 Implementation details</a></h3>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						LuaExec is a regular module using only the legal Lua API.
					</li>
					<li>
						It should work with Lua 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 on POSIX and Windows.
						Not all combinations are fully tested yet.
					</li>
					<li>
						Child tasks are subject to garbage collection in their parent
						that created them. Their underlying OS threads are always joined
						and <em>never killed forcibly</em>, and all resources requested in any
						task are meant to be returned, at the latest through garbage
						collection.
					</li>
					<li>
						A Lua error in a task raises a signal, a (abort), that is by
						default propagated to the parent task.
					</li>
					<li>
						Child tasks and tasks that spawned children are, by default,
						supplied with a debug hook that checks for the abortion signal,
						where it raises an error, signals its parent, and so forth.
					</li>
					<li>
						The hook can be disabled on a per-task basis. In such tasks
						abortion strikes only when they are suspended in wait, sleep etc.
					</li>
				</ul>

		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="status" id="status">1.4. Status, outlook</a></h3>
			<p>
				This project is a prototype and request for comments. Additions,
				suggestions, improvements, bug fixes are likely needed and welcome.
				Performance was no consideration yet. In its current stage LuaExec
				is about getting semantics right. Some considerations:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Because LuaExec is recursive in that child tasks can create new
						tasks that can see other tasks (and can be seen by other tasks),
						LuaExec could easily provide a shared data or registry mechanism.
						This is currently being investigated.
					</li>
					<li>
						LuaExec's protocol and API should be transparent as to whether
						it is implemented as threads or processes, or as threads or
						processes on different hosts.
					</li>
					<li>
						Support for serialization or marshalling
					</li>
					<li>
						Given sufficient interest, this library might be extended in a way
						that other Lua modules and libraries can be written against
						LuaExec's C and Lua APIs, so that future Lua sockets and I/O,
						libraries and applications can converge and be synchronized on
						atomically in a platform-independent, Lua-ish way.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				This project is a spin-off from the
				<a href="http://tekui.neoscientists.org/">tekUI project</a>. The LuaExec 0.80
				module is fully contained in (but usable independently of) tekUI
				version 1.11. The reason for outsourcing was to have a separate
				testbed and package that is unencumbered by the requirements and
				complexity of graphical input and output. There are a few examples
				in this package that can be run against tekUI, and there are a few
				more tasks examples in the tekUI package.

			<p>
				Only for the HTTP example and documentation generator:
				Lua 5.2 and 5.3 must be compiled with <code>LUA_COMPAT_MODULE</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				LuaExec is supposed to work with LuaJIT 2.0, provided that LuaJIT
				implements or can be made to implement <code>lua_newstate()</code> without
				reporting an error. On x86_64 however this has been found to not be
				the case.
			</p>
			<h4>
				External Lua modules
			</h4>
			<p>
				LuaExec does not strictly depend on any external Lua modules. The
				following modules are supported:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/">LuaFileSystem</a> 
						for the HTTP server example and documentation generator
					</li>

						for the HTTP server example
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>

		<div class="node"><h3><a name="buildenv" id="buildenv">2.2. Adjusting the build environment</a></h3>
			<p>
				If building fails for you, you may have to adjust the build
				environment, which is located in the <code>config</code> file on the topmost
				directory level. Supported build tools are <code>gmake</code> (common under
				Linux) and <code>pmake</code> (common under FreeBSD). More build options and
				peculiarities are documented in the tekUI package, many of which
				apply to the LuaExec package as well.
			</p>
			<h4>
				BSD notes
			</h4>
			<p>
				On FreeBSD and NetBSD you need a Lua binary which is linked with the
				<code>-pthread</code> option, as LuaExec is using multithreaded code in shared
				libraries, which are dynamically loaded by the interpreter.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="building" id="building">2.3. Building</a></h3>
			<p>
				To see all build targets, type
			</p>
<pre>
# make help
</pre>
			<p>
				The regular build procedure is invoked with
			</p>
<pre>
# make all
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="installation" id="installation">2.4. Installation</a></h3>
			<p>
				A system-wide installation of LuaExec is not strictly required. Once
				it is built, it can be worked with and developed against, as long as
				you stay in the top-level directory of the distribution; all required
				modules will be found if programs are started from there.
			</p>
			<p>
				If staying in the top-level directory is not desirable, then LuaExec
				must be installed globally. By default, the installation paths are
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">
						<code>/usr/local/lib/lua/5.1</code> 
					</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">
						<code>/usr/local/share/lua/5.1</code> 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				It is not unlikely that this is different from what is common for
				your operating system, distribution or development needs, so be sure
				to adjust these paths in the <code>config</code> file. The installation is
				conveniently invoked with
			</p>
<pre>
# sudo make install
</pre>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="gendoc" id="gendoc">2.5 Documentation system</a></h3>
			<p>
				LuaExec comes with a documentation generator. It is capable of
				generating a function reference and hierarchical class index from
				specially crafted comments in the source code. To regenerate the
				full documentation, invoke
			</p>
<pre>
# make docs
</pre>
			<p>
				Note that you need
				<a href="http://www.keplerproject.org/luafilesystem/">LuaFileSystem</a> for
				the document generator to process the file system hierarchy.

		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="tests" id="tests">3.1 Tests</a></h3>
			<p>
				Examples from the tutorial, HTTP server, and tests are in <code>bin/</code>.
			</p>
		</div>
		<div class="node"><h3><a name="httpserver" id="httpserver">3.2 HTTP Server example</a></h3>
			<p>
				One of the use cases LuaExec was developed against was to supply
				a regular Lua application with an inbuilt HTTP server. It can be
				run in the background like this:
			</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local httpd = exec.run(function()
  require &quot;tek.class.httpd&quot;:new {
    Listen = arg&#091;1&#093;, DocumentRoot = &quot;doc&quot;
  }:run()
end, arg&#091;1&#093; or &quot;localhost:8080&quot;)
-- ... do something else ...
httpd:terminate() -- or httpd:join()
</pre>
			<p>
				To start it serving LuaExec's documentation (default localhost:8080):
			</p>
<pre>
# bin/webserver.lua &#091;host:port&#093;
</pre>
			<p>
				It requires luasocket and lfs. The server itself is not
				multithreaded, due to limitations of the current Lua library
				ecosystem, but it supports copas/coxpcall if available.
			</p>
			<p>
				These links should work when you have loaded this document from the
				provided HTTP server:
			</p>
			<blockquote>
				<ul>
					<li>
						CGI test page: <a href="/webserver/testcgi.lua">/webserver/testcgi.lua</a> 
					</li>
					<li>
						Formtest Lua page: <a href="/webserver/formtest.lhtml">/webserver/formtest.lhtml</a> 
					</li>
					<li>
						Webserver control Lua page: <a href="/webserver/control.lhtml">/webserver/control.lhtml</a> 
					</li>
				</ul>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
				Please note that the HTTP/1.1 part of the server was not thoroughly
				written against specifications. It is included as an example and may
				get improved and become a separate package some day.
			</p>

		</div>
		<div class="node"><h2><a name="tutorial" id="tutorial">4. Quickstart tutorial</a></h2>
			<p>
				For the first part of this tutorial, please run Lua in interactive
				mode, because this is going to be fun, and hopefully instructive!
				Start off by requiring the LuaExec module:
			</p>
<pre>
# lua
&gt; exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
</pre>
			<p>
				What's our task's name?
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; print(exec.getname())
=&gt; main
</pre>
			<p>
				Sleep a second (1000 milliseconds):
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; exec.sleep(1000)
</pre>
			<p>
				Now to starting a new task:
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; exec.run(function() end)
=&gt;
</pre>
			<p>
				Nothing happened? Well, it probably just ran and exited.
				Let's have it do something:
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; exec.run(function() print &quot;hello&quot; end)
=&gt; hello
</pre>
			<p>
				Seems reasonable. Now let's have it do some work:
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; exec.run(function() while true do end end)
</pre>
			<p>
				So far, so good. Do you notice some change in the behaviour of your
				computer? Probably not. Ok, then try it again...
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; exec.run(function() while true do end end)
</pre>
			<p>
				Still nothing? Then try this:
			</p>
<pre>
&gt; for i = 1, 4 do exec.run(function() while true do end end) end
</pre>
			<p>
				Wait a moment. Some fans spinning up possibly?
			</p>
			<p>
				I think it's time to quit interactive mode now rather quickly.
				I hope your Lua interpreter has proper interactive mode, so that
				it is orderly closed down and you see the intended effect.
				Press CTRL-D now (not CTRL-C):

</pre>
			<p>
				Each of the tasks started above running an infinite loop should now
				receive an abortion signal from Lua closing down and performing
				garbage collection. This causes each task to raise an error, and
				consequently to report that error. This is a very important
				aspect of LuaExec. (And by dissipating heat we just may have helped
				the universe to approach its destiny a little sooner, but this
				remains to be seen.)
			</p>
			<p>
				The next examples are performed in scripts. To reiterate what was
				said above, run the following script. You'll get a stack trace from
				the child, because it has not finished voluntarily when the main
				program is ending:
			</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
exec.run(function()
  while true do end
end)
=&gt;
luatask: received abort signal
stack traceback:
        bin/tutorial.lua:3: in function &lt;bin/tutorial.lua:2&gt;
        &#091;C&#093;: in ?
</pre>
		</div>
	<p>
		On the other hand, if it has finished voluntarily, everything
		remains silent:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
exec.run(function()
end)
exec.sleep(100)
=&gt;
</pre>
	<p>
		I have added the last line to drive home that point, because your
		funny operating system could theoretically decide to postpone
		execution of the child task just long enough, so that we ended up
		with an error and a stracktrace nonetheless. (Told in confidence,
		this is not true, <em>this</em> example wouldn't raise a signal even without
		sleeping in the parent, but this is an implementation detail.)
	</p>
	<p>
		Note that although this is the plushy world of Lua, and LuaExec tries
		its best to hide the nastiness of multithreaded programming from you,
		trailing behind a bunch of dangling threads is by no means an
		encouraged programming technique. What <em>is</em> encouraged is that you
		synchronize your program on the completion of each task. This also
		allows you to take delivery of return values:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run(function()
  return &quot;successful&quot;, &quot;indeed&quot;
end)
print(c:join())
=&gt;
true    successful      indeed
</pre>
	<p>
		Next we should ask ourselves what threads are actually good for.
		Especially in the Lua world this seems to be hotly debated -
	</p>
	<p>
		In computations, actually, it is difficult to put them to good use,
		but matters improved a bit in that regard, with projects like
		SETI@home, mining bitcoins, and so on. There are plenty of CPU cycles
		to be wasted in fun computations, especially if you run them in a
		scripting language. Wouldn't it be a pity if we couldn't saturate
		eight cores from a one-liner in Lua?
	</p>
	<p>
		Irony aside, threads have always been useful for long-running tasks,
		regardless of their computational demand, and they are even more
		useful if they are bound to I/O operations that are precisely <em>not</em> 
		demanding computationally, but stuttering, jerky, and unpredictable,
		and spend most of their time waiting, but it is impossible to tell
		for how long, and if the wait will even turn out a result. Also note
		that from a computer's viewpoint a human could be seen as a very
		demanding I/O device, making it a good candidate for a thread or two
		to deal with, although that may not be the most popular take on that
		matter.
	</p>
	<p>
		So in I/O, that's where computing leaves academia and hits the hard
		cobbles of reality:
		Imagine you were writing a virus scanner with a graphical user
		interface (you wouldn't want to write such a software, for all the
		money in the world, I know! This is just an example) - would you
		start a task each time the scan button is clicked? No, you would
		start that task when the application starts, put it to sleep, and in
		it wait for the order to scan, that is what you'd do.
		Or rather, that's what I'd do, and I may be completely off the track,
		because I would allow the user to enter the configuration panels and
		other sections of the program even while such a scan is in progress.
	</p>
	<p>
		First let's see how we can start and stop such an application worker:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run(function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  print &quot;worker running&quot;
  print(exec.wait())
  return &quot;worker done&quot;
end)
exec.sleep(1000)
print(c:terminate())
=&gt;
worker running
t
true    worker done
</pre>
	<p>
		There is a new function to end the child task, terminate, and
		another new function, wait, that by sheer chance waits until the main
		program calls terminate on the child. What wait really does, however,
		is that it waits until it receives any one or more signals from a set
		of possible signals, and returns the ones received to the caller. The
		signal <strong>t</strong> is included in the default set, and it is important
		enough to be supported by a function on the other end, terminate, that
		really does nothing but to send the <strong>t</strong> signal, and then to behave
		exactly like join. So this would be equivalent to the last line:
	</p>
<pre>
c:signal(&quot;t&quot;)
print(c:join())
</pre>
	<p>
		There are more signals, but the t signal is the most gentle one, with
		the predefined meaning &quot;pretty please, could you quit?&quot;. There is
		nothing wrong if you received this signal and did nothing in reaction,
		and nothing keeps you from assigning it a different meaning.
	</p>
	<p>
		By now it has probably dawned upon Unix connoisseurs that
		LuaExec signals have got <strong>nil</strong> to do with Unix signals, although
		there are some artifical similarities in their names. The meanings
		reserved to them are completely different.
	</p>
	<p>
		Rowdies and bullies among you (who have an exceptional attention
		span to be still following this tutorial) surely want to see the
		brutal termination of a task. We can't help but to admit that this
		needs to be mentioned, so pay attention, we will do this only once,
		because we wouldn't want to further support your urge to destroy
		things:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run(function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  for i = 1, 1000000000 do end
  exec.wait()
end)
exec.sleep(1000)
c:abort()
=&gt;
luatask: received abort signal
stack traceback:
        bin/tutorial.lua:4: in function &lt;bin/tutorial.lua:2&gt;
        &#091;C&#093;: in ?
</pre>
	<p>
		It doesn't matter what the child task is doing, as long as it is in
		Lua code or a LuaExec function, it will be interrupted. Here again
		the <code>abort</code> method is just the short form for sending a signal, in
		this case <strong>a</strong> for abort, and then to <code>join</code>. But why would you
		want to call abort at all? In exchange you are getting an ugly stack
		trace that you somehow need to hide from your audience whom you
		wanted to convince of using your program, and this is even done
		automatically for you when your program ends and if there are still
		tasks running. We leave it at that it is a rather exceptional thing
		to do.
	</p>
	<p>
		Signals are important, even essential, but their number is limited,
		only four in fact, of which we know two already, and of which there
		is only one free for the user, <strong>t</strong>. There could be more signals,
		user signals 1, 2, 3, <code>SIGFOO</code>, you name them. But we asked
		ourselves, why even stop there? No, we have kept the number of
		signals at the bare minimum so that you won't have to ponder
		needlessly on freaked out meanings that could be assigned to them.
	</p>
	<p>
		Because, there is a tool that is so much more powerful, based on,
		but transcending signals.
		This tool is called messages. Messages can be any data, you can
		reserve all meaning in the world to them, and with them, you can
		even do without signals:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run(function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  print &quot;your orders please!&quot;
  while true do
    local order, sender = exec.waitmsg()
    print(order, sender)
    if order == &quot;quit&quot; then
      break
    end
  end
end)
exec.sleep(1000)
c:sendmsg(&quot;scan&quot;)
exec.sleep(1000)
c:sendmsg(&quot;quit&quot;)
c:join()
=&gt;
your orders please!
scan    main
quit    main
</pre>
	<p>
		You can send any string (even ones containing unprintable data)
		around in messages, and not only that, you will also know who has
		sent you a message, in this example the main program, <code>&quot;main&quot;</code>.
	</p>
	<p>
		By receiving the sender together with the message you can write a
		worker that is completely ignorant of the rest of the world, it just
		takes the next order, executes it, and sends the result back to the
		originator. Our first real worker will compute 5 random numbers
		between 1 and 10:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run(function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  while true do
    local order, sender = exec.waitmsg()
    if order == &quot;getrandom&quot; then
      exec.sendmsg(sender, math.random(1, 10))
    elseif order == &quot;quit&quot; then
      break
    end
  end
end)
for i = 1, 5 do
  c:sendmsg(&quot;getrandom&quot;)
  print(exec.waitmsg())
end
c:sendmsg(&quot;quit&quot;)
c:join()
=&gt;
8       task: 0x7f4e60000af0    m
3       task: 0x7f4e60000af0    m
7       task: 0x7f4e60000af0    m
7       task: 0x7f4e60000af0    m
9       task: 0x7f4e60000af0    m
</pre>
	<p>
		Some commentary is probably advised. The first column in the output
		is the returned message body, the second the name of the sender, as
		we already know from the previous example. Because here the sender
		is the child task and the child task has no name, LuaExec has given
		it a name for identification.
	</p>
	<p>
		The third return value from waitmsg is the signal that caused waitmsg
		to return, and by this we also get to know the third signal, <strong>m</strong> 
		for message, which indicates that, you guessed it, the task has
		received a message. Please note, however, that it is entirely
		possible that there is no signal that causes waitmsg to return (in
		which case the third return value will be <strong>nil</strong>), because
		returning the signal to the caller also clears it from the task, and
		there may be more messages arriving in the meantime, in which case
		waitmsg will return the next message immediately.
	</p>
	<p>
		To conclude this introductory tutorial, didn't we say eight cores?
	</p>
	<p>
		Well, of course none of these exercises in futility have got anything
		to do with cores, but here's the same worker again (this time we have
		given it a name), and ten other tasks requesting random numbers from
		it:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run({ taskname = &quot;worker&quot;, func = function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  while true do
    local order, sender = exec.waitmsg()
    if order == &quot;getrandom&quot; then
      exec.sendmsg(sender, math.random(1, 10))
    elseif order == &quot;quit&quot; then
      break
    end
  end
end })
for i = 1, 10 do
  exec.run(function()
    local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
    for i = 1, 10 do
      exec.sendmsg(&quot;worker&quot;, &quot;getrandom&quot;)
      print(exec.waitmsg())
    end
  end)
end
exec.sleep(1000)
c:sendmsg(&quot;quit&quot;)
c:join()
=&gt;
1       worker  m
10      worker  nil
510     worker          workerm
m
8       worker  m
...
</pre>
	<p>
		You may find the output a bit scrambed sometimes, like I do on my
		computer. This is harmless and due to the fact that multiple tasks
		are writing to standard output at the same time. The exact behaviour
		may vary between different operating systems, but even if you don't
		get a scrambled output on your computer, you may still get the point.
	</p>
	<p>
		Of course we can still do worse than that. To expose this tutorial
		to ridicule once and for all, in the final example the results will
		be passed on to the main task, which prints them, so the main task
		becomes the stdout worker, in a sense:
	</p>
<pre>
local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
local c = exec.run({ taskname = &quot;worker&quot;, func = function()
  local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
  while true do
    local order, sender = exec.waitmsg()
    if order == &quot;getrandom&quot; then
      exec.sendmsg(sender, math.random(1, 10))
    elseif order == &quot;quit&quot; then
      break
    end
  end
end })
for i = 1, 10 do
  exec.run(function()
    local exec = require &quot;tek.lib.exec&quot;
    for i = 1, 10 do
      exec.sendmsg(&quot;worker&quot;, &quot;getrandom&quot;)
      local number = exec.waitmsg()
      exec.sendmsg(&quot;*p&quot;, number)
    end
  end)
end
for i = 1, 100 do
  print(exec.waitmsg())
end
c:sendmsg(&quot;quit&quot;)
c:join()
</pre>
	<p>
		Besides prettier output, here we have another feature of LuaExec,
		addressing a task by the name <code>&quot;*p&quot;</code>, which sends a message to a
		task's parent task.
