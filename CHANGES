== LuaExec Changelog ==

 * HTTPD class: Added DoDirList attribute, added support for 403 Forbidden,
 added ExtraWebEnvironment, added default index including handler invocation,
 added logging
 * Debug: added NOTE level, better adaptability for e.g. syslog

=== 0.83: ===

 * Changes to the class and documentation system, no longer requires
 Lua 5.2, 5.3 to be compiled with LUA_COMPAT_MODULE
 * Windows HAL: Now uses atomics instead of locking
 * Interpreter is now created using lua_newstate so that it may bail
 out on LuaJIT with a meaningful message; updated documentation to reflect
 that not all hope may be lost on LuaJIT
 * The intent of supporting LuaJIT has been dismissed, because LuaJIT
 does not fully implement the Lua API. This would have been a
 requirement to circumvent its divergent behaviour. 

=== 0.82: ===

 * LuaExec: in join() abort signals could be forwarded to already dead
 task, corrected by freeing task after return from exec, in waitmsg()
 fixed recalculation of waittime, returned signals should be correct now
 * Examples from tutorial and some stress tests added
 * Exec: added semi-internal function TFreeTask(), user tasks are now
 freed in destructor context after their return from exec, minor cleanup
 in memory functions

=== 0.81: ===

 * quickstart tutorial added
 * fixed severe bugs in sender name retrieval
 * POSIX/Windows HAL setsignal(): sigmask was not applied to new signals,
 corrected
 * HTTP server: is no longer installed, http:terminate() now works,
 cleaned up to more clearly demonstrate signal usage
 * If a task has no name, the implied name is now "task: 0x<address>"
 so that replies can be sent to unnamed senders
 * Some additions and corrections in the documentation

=== 0.80: ===

 * added
